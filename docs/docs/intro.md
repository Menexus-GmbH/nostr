# Get Started

## What is this ?

`dart_nostr` is a Dart/Flutter SDK for teh [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) protocol, the package is meant as an implmentation o the Nostr [documentations & specs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md).

This packkages abstracts the complexity that might face when trying to connect to relays, send/receive events, listen to events callbacks.. and provide solutions to the problems and difficultis that you will face in the future (How I knew That? because I am also a developer who worked with it).

This package exposes Dart APIs to perform easy-to-use functionality for your next apps, this means for you:

- More development time saved & gained.
- Easy-to-use methods/functionality.
- Less problems that you will face in the future.
- Developer friendly.
- As a Dart/Flutter developer, you will feel at home.
- Gain the ability to easily extens it's functionality to meet your very special use-case.


## Wait, What is Nostr ?

Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

Well, I could throw an global overview about it here for the next 1200 words. but instead, I recommend you to check first the availabe =official resource of it, these are some of wha you need to check:

- [Nostr Website](https://nostr.com/)
- [Nostr Github Repository](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr)
- [Nostr NIPs Github Repository](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips)

This package allows you to apply almost all NIPs that exists for the Nostr protocol, you can create events with your own customization for kinds, tags... and send them to relays, or you can listen to them.

## Documentation

I am writing this documentation website since I saw that self-learning it from it's code and integrated dart doc might be overwhelming and non-sense. Here, I will treat you like myself seeing tring this package for the first time, and so you will find all sections from the sidebar of all functionality that you can achieve with it.
