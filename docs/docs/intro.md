# Get Started

Hello, welcome to the `dart_nostr` package documentation, it will serve you as a reference to learn & use this package more properly.

I'am Mohamed Anas, and I'am a 20 yo developer, I made this package because I think it will help people in the future.

Let's start.

## General Overview

### What is this ?

`dart_nostr` is a Dart/Flutter SDK for the [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) protocol, the package is meant as an implementation of the Nostr [documentations & specs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md).

This packages abstracts the complexity that might face when trying to connect to relays web sockets, send/receive events, listen to events callbacks & much more. And provides a solutions to the problems and difficulties that you will face in the future if you tried implementing things yourself (How I knew That? because I am also a developer who worked with it).

This package exposes Dart APIs to perform easy-to-use functionality for your future apps, this means for you:

- More development time saved & gained.
- Easy-to-use methods/functionality.
- Less problems that you will face in the future.
- Developer friendly.
- As a Dart/Flutter developer, you will feel at home.
- Gain the ability to easily extens it's functionality to meet your very special use-case.

### Wait, What is Even Nostr ?

[Nostr](https://nostr.com) is an open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

Well, I could throw an global overview about it here for the next 1200 words. but instead, I recommend you to check first the available official resources of it, these are some of what you need to check:

- [Nostr Website](https://nostr.com/)
- [Nostr Github Repository](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr)
- [Nostr NIPs Github Repository](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips)

This package allows you to apply almost all Nostr [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) that exists for the Nostr protocol, you can create events with your own customization for kinds, tags... and send them to relays, or you can listen & use them.

### Why this Documentation ?

I am writing this documentation website since I saw that self-learning the package from its code and the generated [dart doc](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-doc) might be overwhelming and non-sense. especially if you're new.

Here, I will treat you like myself seeing this package for the first time and starting with Nostr, you will find all the guides & informations you need from the sidebar on the left.
