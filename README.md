**help this gets discovered and noticed by other developers with a star ‚≠ê**

This package is a client for the [Nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/). It is a wrapper that lets you interact with the Nostr protocol in an easier, faster and more organized way.

## NIPS that you can expect to implement and use with this package:

**What this means?**, it means that you can check the official Nostr documentation and their NIPs, and then you can expect an implementation of it in this package so you can get your things done faster and easier.

Some NIPs have a custom implementation in this package like the NIP-05, which you can check from here.

Some other implementations are not intended to work in the Dart environment, so they are not implemented in this package, such as NIP-07 which is based on the `window` object of a browser. that being said it can be implemented separately if there is a use of Flutter web, but for now, it is not implemented.

NIP-01, NIP-02, NIP-03, NIP-04 (TODO: make the encryption part automated by the package), NIP-05, NIP-06, NIP-09, NIP-10, NIP-11, NIP-12, NIP-13, NIP-14, NIP-16, NIP-18, NIP-20, NIP-23, NIP-25, NIP-27, NIP-28, NIP-33, NIP-36, NIP-39, NIP-40, NIP-56, NIP-65.

## TODO (if you want to contribute, please feel free to implement any of the following NIPS and make a pull request, I will be happy to review it and merge it.)
 
NIP-19, NIP-26, NIP-42, NIP-45, NIP-50, NIP-51, NIP-57, NIP-58

# Usage:

The main and only singleton instance that you need to use to access all other services of this package is:

```dart
Nostr.instance;
```

`Nostr.instance` offers access to all services of this package which they-self offer many other members/functions to get your things done:

```dart
Nostr.instance.keysService; // access to the keys service, which will provide methods to handle user key pairs, private keys, public keys, etc.

Nostr.instance.relaysService; // access to the relays service, which will provide methods to interact with your own relays such as sending events, listening to events, etc.

Nostr.instance.utilsService; // access the utils service, which provides many handy utils that you will need to use in your app, such as encoding, getting random hex strings to use with requests, etc.
```

<br>

## Keys Service:

This service is responsible for handling anything that is related to the nostr keys including generating and deriving private & public keys, signing and verifying messages, etc.

#### Generate a new key pair:

In order to generate a new key pair of a private and a public keys, you will need to call the `generateKeyPair()` method, which will return a `NostrKeyPairs` object that contains them:

```dart
NostrKeyPairs keyPair = Nostr.instance.keysService.generateKeyPair();

print(keyPair.private); // ...
print(keyPair.public); // ...

// or maybe give it to your user so he owns it.
```

#### Get a key pair from an existent private key:

when you have an existent private key, you can get it's key pair directly by calling the `generateKeyPairFromExistingPrivateKey()` method, which will return a `NostrKeyPairs` object that contains that private key and it's associated public key.

```dart
NostrKeyPairs keyPair = Nostr.instance.keysService.generateKeyPairFromExistingPrivateKey(privateKey);
```

#### generate and get a new private key directly:

Sometimes, you will need to only generate a private key and not a key pair, in this case, you can call the `generatePrivateKey()` method, which will return a `String` that contains the generated private key directly.

```dart
String privateKey = await Nostr.instance.keysService.generatePrivateKey();
```

#### Sign and verify a message:

To sign a message, you will need to call the `sign()` method, which will return a `String` that contains the signature of the message, then if you want to verify that message, you can call the `verify()` method, which will return a `bool` that indicates if the message is verified or not.

```dart
String message = ...;
String signature = await Nostr.instance.keysService.sign(
  privateKey: privateKey,
  message: message,
);
print(signature); // ...

bool isVerified = await Nostr.instance.keysService.verify(
  publicKey: publicKey,
  message: message,
  signature: signature,
);
print(isMessageVerified); // ...
```

<br>

## Relays Service:

The relays service is responsible for anything related to the actual interaction with relays such connecting to them, sending events to them, listening to events from them, etc.

#### Creating and signing Nostr events:

You can get the final events that you will send to your relays by either creating a raw `NostrEvent` object and then you will need to generate and set literally all its properties by yourself using the Nostr protocol specifications which you will need to have a basic [understanding of it](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) :

```dart

  final event = NostrEvent(
    pubkey: '<THE-PUBKEY-OF-THE-EVENT-CREATOR>',
    kind: 0,
    content: 'This is a test event content',
    createdAt: DateTime.now(),
    id: '<THE-ID-OF-THE-EVENT>', // you will need to generate and set the id of the event manually by hashing other event fields, please refer to the official Nostr protocol documentation to learn how to do it yourself.
    tags: [],
    sig: '<THE-SIGNATURE-OF-THE-EVENT>', // you will need to generate and set the signature of the event manually by signing the event's id, please refer to the official Nostr protocol documentation to learn how to do it yourself.
  );
```

As it is explained, this will require you to set every single value of the event properties manually, including the `id` and `sig` values.

Well, we al lve easy things right? This package offers the option to handle all this internally and covers you in this part with the  `NostrEvent.fromPartialData(...)` which requires you to only set the direct necessary fields and the rest will be handled internally so you don't need to worry about it:

```dart
final pair = Nostr.instance.keysService.generateKeyPair();

  final event = NostrEvent.fromPartialData(
    kind: 0,
    keyPairs: pair,
    content: 'This is a test event content',
    tags: [],
    createdAt: DateTime.parse('...'),,
  );
```

The only required fields here are `kind`, `keyPairs` and `content`.

- if `tags` is ignored, it will be set to an empty list `[]`.

- if `createdAt` is ignored, it will be set to the current date `DateTime.now()` .

- other fields like `id`, `sign` and pubkey is what you don't need to worry about, they will be generated and set internally.


`NostrEvent.fromPartialData` requires the `keyPairs` because it needs to get the private key to sign the event and assign to the `sign` field, and it needs to get the public key to use it as the `pubkey` of the event.



#### Connecting to relay(s):

As I already said, this package exposes only one main instance, which is `Nostr.instance`, you will need to initialize/connect to your relay(s) only one time in your Dart/Flutter app with:

```dart
Nostr.instance.relaysService.init(
  
  relaysUrl: ['wss://relay.damus.io'],
  
  onRelayListening: (String relayUrl, receivedData) {}, // will be called once a relay is connected and listening to events.
  
  onRelayError: (String relayUrl, Object? error) {}, // will be called once a relay is disconnected or an error occurred.
  
  onRelayDone: (String relayUrl) {}, // will be called once a relay is disconnected, finished.
  
  lazyListeningToRelays: false, // if true, the relays will not start listening to events until you call `Nostr.instance.relaysService.startListeningToRelays()`, if false, the relays will start listening to events as soon as they are connected.

  retryOnError: false, // Weither to ro retry connecting to relay(s) if an error occurred to them .
  
  retryOnClose: false, // Weither to ro retry connecting to relay(s) if they are closed.
  
  bool ensureToClearRegistriesBeforeStarting = true, // Weither to clear the registries of the relays before starting to listen to them, this is useful if you want to implmenta  reconnecting feature, so that you will totally clear previous connections and start a new one.

  bool ignoreConnectionException: true, // Weither to ignore any exception that occurs while connecting to relay(s) or not (if false, the exception will be thrown and you will have to catch it).

  bool shouldReconnectToRelayOnNotice = false, // Weither to reconnect to relay(s) if they sent a [NOTICE, ...] message.
  
  Duration connectionTimeout = const Duration(seconds: 5), // The timeout of the connection to relay(s).
  
);
```

The only required field here is `relaysUrl`, which accepts a `List<String>` that contains the URLs of your relays web sockets, you can pass as many relays as you want.

I personally recommend initializing the relays service in the `main()` function of your app, so that it will be initialized as soon as the app starts, and then it will be available to be used anywhere and anytime in your app.

```dart
void main() {
Nostr.instance.relaysService.init(...);

// if it is a flutter app: runApp(MyApp());
//...
 }
```

#### Listening to events from relay(s):

For listening to events from relay(s), you will need to create a `NostrRequest` first with the specify your request type and filters = that you wanna apply as example:

```dart
// creating the request.
final req = NostrRequest(
 filters: [
   NostrFilter(
     kind: 1,
     tags: ["p", "..."],
     authors: ["..."],
   ),
 ],
);

// creating a stream of events.
NostrEventsStream nostrEventsStream = Nostr.instance.relaysService.startEventsSubscription(req);

// listening to the stream.
nostrEventsStream.stream.listen((event) {
  print(event);
});

// closing the nostr nostr events stream after 10 seconds (and yes this will close it for all relays that you're listening to)
Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 10)).then((value) {  
  nostrEventsStream.close();
});
```

#### Sending events to relay(s):

When you have an event that is ready to be sent to your relay(s) as exmaple the [previous event](#creating-and-signing-nostr-events) that we did created, you can call the `sendEventToRelays()` method with it and send it to relays:

```dart
Nostr.instance.relaysService.sendEventToRelays(event);
```

The event will be sent now to all the connected relays now, and if you're already openeing a subsciption to your relays, you will start receiving it in your stream.

#### nip-05 identifier verification:

in order to verify a user pubkey with his internet identifier, you will need to call the `verifyNip05()` function with the user's pubkey and internet identifier as the only parameters:

```dart
bool isVerified = await Nostr.instance.relaysService.verifyNip05(
  internetIdentifier: '<THE-INTERNET-IDENTIFIER-OF-THE-USER>',
  pubkey: '<THE-PUBKEY-OF-THE-USER>',
);

print(isVerified); // ...
```

if the user is verified, the function will return `true`.

#### Relay Information Document:

You can get the relay information document (NIP 11) by calling the `getRelayInformationDocument()` function with the relay's URL as the only parameter:

```dart

  RelayInformations relayInformationDocument = await Nostr.instance.relaysService.getRelayInformationDocument(
    relayUrl: 'wss://relay.damus.io',
  );
  print(relayInformationDocument.supportedNips); // ...
```
